  <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
  <p> My name is Esosa Esezobor, and I'm from Benin, Nigeria. I work as a teaching assistant in the English Department, NMSU. My interests include language learning acquisition, UX Research & Design, technical writing and closed captioning. </p>

  <!-- i guess this where i could attach projects from this class or my writing, depends -->
  <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
  <p>
    This is where I will be placing my first project from this class. Maybe I can include the UX testing report with Q4C here too
  </p>

  <h2> Other Projects</h2>
  <p>
    This is where I will describe another project or sample. Maybe it can include a link that takes me to a grid list of other projects while the first paragraph shows the most recent project or the best one.
