  <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
  <p> My name is Sosa Esezobor. I grew up in a big city, Lagos, Nigeria. In August 2024, I moved from my home in Nigeria to Las Cruces, New Mexico to begin my masters program in Rhetoric & Professional Communication at the NMSU English Department. I also work as a teaching assistant where I teach Technical & Professional Communication. When I am not teaching or attending classes, I coordinate activities and mentor tutors at the University Writing Center. My research interests include UX Research & Design, sound politics and closed captioning. I am also a digital content creator and beauty enthusiast and I create makeup tutorials & videos on social media for fun!</p>

    Here are some projects I have completed in my Web Development class.

<div class="project-section">
    <!-- Fiction Web Project -->
    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Fiction Business Website Project</h3>
      <p>
        This is a collaborative fictional business website for Los Pollos Hermanos from the Breaking Bad show. This was created with my team members from my Web Development class, Aaron Treolar and Eli Severns. 
        I contributed to developing the site structure, writing content, and layout decisions.

  <h3>First Website as a Beginner Web Developer(MDN Tutorial)</h3>
  <p>
    This was the very first website I built while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    using the MDN “Your First Website” tutorial. At first, the
    structure and tags were difficult and confusing, but as the course progressed, the
    concepts became clearer and I got confident in building web pages
    from scratch.

  <!-- Princess Tiana CSS Project -->
<div class="project-card">
  <h3>Princess Tiana Themed CSS Website</h3>
  <p>
    A creative CSS-focused project inspired by Princess Tiana from Disney’s The Princess and the Frog.
    The goal of this assignment was to design a fully styled webpage using only HTML and CSS.
    My design earned extra credit for creativity and visuals.
